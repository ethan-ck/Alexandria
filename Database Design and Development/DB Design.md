- Design must be Logical (portable), this means that it is a design without regard to a relational database management system. (RDMS)

- Physical Design
	- The Logical design adapted to a particular DBMS 
	- Fluid design that can change during implementation 

- Entity Relation Diagrams (ERD)
	- These are a common way of diagramming entities, their attributes, and their relationships
	- A great way to put your design thinking onto paper
	- Essentially the same as a Branch Topic and topic 
	- An entity is represented as a rectangle divided into three parts
		- Top = Name of the entity
		- Middle box = primary key
		- Bottom = attributes 

- Relationships
	- A relationship is established by repeating one field from one table to another
		- This key is usually a foreign key 
	- The primary key table can be referred to as the parent table, or master table
	- Tables with the foriegn keys are sometimes referred to as child table
