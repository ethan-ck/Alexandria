To put it simply, a database is a collection of related data. 

Databases do not have to be online, they can be made in a notebook or any other forms of pen and paper. However, whenever someone talks about a database, they are usually referring to an electronic database. In fact, this app is a prime example of an electronic database! This database is a Hierarchal database on a computer. 

In this class, there are three types of databases. *Revise*

Flat-File Databases
A Flat-File database is the simplest form of databases. It consists of a data file that stores data in a structured way. There are multiple formats for a Flat-File database. 

One such format is a flat file with a delimiter. 

A delimiter is a character that separates each data entry, a comma is commonly used as a delimiter. For example, a text document that separates each data entry with a comma. This text document would also be referred to as a CSV file.

Another type of flat data file is the fixed-width file. All the columns share a fixed width in characters. In this case, we can see that each data entry is separated into rows and columns.

Spreadsheets are more versatile in the sense that they contain the data tools that make it possible to sort and group data. These data tools come in the form of functions. A function in Excel for example, allows the user to use pre-defined instructions to deliver a result on the selected cells.

The final type of non-relational databases is called the Hierarchical Database. Hierarchical databases was the most common model before the relational model was introduced. These databases operate in a similar style to file paths for computers. One "parent" table can have multiple "child" tables. 

C:\\Users\\ExampleUser\\Documents\\myfile.txt

With all types of non-relational databases, they share common flaws. One such flaw is redundancy. 

Redundancy refers to repeating the same data more than once. 

Another issue occurs when updating a data entry. If one person updates a data entry, they may fail to update other versions of the database or fail to notify the correct individuals about the information (AKA data integrity).
