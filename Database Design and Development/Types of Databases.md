To put it simply, a database is a collection of related data. 

Databases do not have to be online, they can be made in a notebook or any other forms of pen and paper. However, whenever someone talks about a database, they are usually referring to an electronic database. In fact, this app is a prime example of an electronic database! This database is a Hierarchal database on a computer. 

In this class, there are three types of databases. *Revise*

Flat-File Databases
A Flat-File database is the simplest form of databases. It consists of a data file that stores data in a structured way. There are multiple formats for a Flat-File database. 

One such format is a flat file with a delimiter. 

A delimiter is a character that separates each data entry, a comma is commonly used as a delimiter. For example, a text document that separates each data entry with a comma. This text document would also be referred to as a CSV file.

Another type of flat data file is the fixed-width file. All the columns share a fixed width in characters. In this case, we can see that each data entry is separated into rows and columns.

The third and final type of flat file database is a spreadsheet. 

With all types of non-relational databases, they share  common flaws. They all are prone to redundancy. 

Redundancy refers to repeating the same data more than once. 

Another issue occurs when updating a data entry. If one person updates a data entry, they may fail to update other versions of the database or fail to notify the correct individuals about the information.
