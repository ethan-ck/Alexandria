- There are multiple ways to set up access control for users

- Discretionary Access Control
	- Every resource has an owner
	- Uses ACLs (a file management system)
	- Access is resource-specific, meaning that an owner can set how much access is needed per resource

- Mandatory Access Control
	- Every object has a label
	- Every user has a level
	- All or nothing access
	- Think of security clearances, secret, top secret, confidential 

- Role-Based Access Control
	- Most common, access is based on what role you are 
	- Roles determine access (ex. Managers have access to these things, Receptionist access to the calender files only)

- Rule-Based Access Control
	- Used with routers
	- Allows or denies, uses router ACLs
	- Similar to a whitelist

- Attribute-Based Access
	- Flexible
	- combines attributes (user, role, etc..)
	- If-else-then statements
