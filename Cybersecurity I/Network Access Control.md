- NAC is a policy-driven control process that allows or denies certain devices for security reasons
- Remediated = fixed

- User goes into the NAC for a health check before accessing the network
	- If the user passes, you go to the network
	- If the user fails, you go to the remediation network (zone) until you pass the health check

- Mantrap
	- Access control Vestibule

- Entry points + Endpoints + Attack Surface

- Baseline is normal

- Network Segmentation
	- Split up the network to subnets for harder access for malicious actors
	- VLANs split up the network 

- Passive Reconnaissance
	- Not intruding, just gathering information
	- Can be anyone

- Active Reconnaissance
	- Seeking ports, topology, protocols, scanning, etc...

- VLAN
	- Divides physical switches into smaller virtual switches
	- Saves money (not buying a ton of switches)
	- Example. 16 switches on a switch = 4 for accounting, 4 for development, etc...
	- Can be reassigned easily via software
	- Trunk ports
		- Allow same VLANs to communicate with an outer router
		- Trunk ports are connected physically on two switches 
		- Must be configured

- SCADA Supervisor Control or ICS
	- For manufacturing plants

- Network Device Vulnerabilities 
	- Privilege Escalation
		- Get permissions beyond what you normally have
	- Backdoor
		- Trojans
	- Zero-Day-Vulnerability
		- A vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor the day the software releases
	- CVEs
		- Common stuff

- Principle of Least Privilege
	- Give users the bare minimum that they require to do their job

- National Institute of Standards and Technologies
	- Keeps a national database

- Peer to Peer (P2P)
	- Share content without centralized servers

- Traditional
	- Server to many clients 

- Data exfiltration
	- Data leaking

- Switch Security and Attacks
