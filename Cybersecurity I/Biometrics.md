- What you are

- Positives and Negatives in Authentication
	- Positive lets you in
	- False positive means someone who was not supposed to get in got in
	- False negative means a person who was supposed to get in did not get in
	- Negative does not let you in

- Intrusion Detection
	- Positive "I found something" not good
		- False positive means it's a non-threat
	- Negative "I did not find anything" good
		- False negative means that a threat got through and was not detected - very bad 

- Common biometrics include:
	- Fingerprint
		- Enrollment, then Verification, (Identification)
	- Voice
	- Face
		- Could be inaccurate due to angles and lighting'
		- Phones with multiple cameras and scanners are more accurate than a single camera, harder to fool
		- 
	- Signature
	- Retina
	- Hand
	- Iris

- Cost VS. Accuracy 
	- Iris is high cost, high accuracy
	- Retina and Finger are in-between
	- Voice, Face Signature, hand varies by price, low accuracy
	- There is no perfect solution

- Crossover Rate
	- Where there is an even number of false positives and false negatives
	- Acceptable for the average person, not for high security people
		- High Security aim for less false positives, more false negatives
		- For Forensic people, you want more false positives as you want to find people
