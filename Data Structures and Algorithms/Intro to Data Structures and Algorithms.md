A Data Structure is a structure that organizes data 
	There are many differing types of data structures that are used for different reasons. There is not a single data structure that is superior to the others, and each DS is unique in their own ways.

	For example, a tree data structure uses a parent/child relationship to organize data, while an array uses indexes for each dataset. 

Algorithms - A series of instructions to accomplish a specific task. For example, here is **one** algorithm for making tea:

	Making Tea
	1. Boil Water
	2. Add a teabag to a cup
	3. Pour the boiling water into th cup
	4. Remove the teabag when tea is ready
	5. Add the desired amount of milk
	6. Add the desired amount of sugar
	7. Stir the contents of the cup 

An Algorithm is **NOT** an implementation. Algorithms are purely pseudocode, and differ from the actual code you write. 

As a result, there are many ways to implement the algorithm described above for making tea. For example, in step one, it says to boil water. It does not say whether to use a pot or kettle to boil the water, so implementations is entirely up to the reader.
