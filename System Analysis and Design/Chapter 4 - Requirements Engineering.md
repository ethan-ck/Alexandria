		- O- Report/list
		- I - inputs
	- security

		- more expensive
		- large groups can be cumbersome
	- Advantages
		- Allows key users to participate effectively
		- Users are more likely to feel a sense of ownership
		- Accurate statement of system requirements

- Rapid Application Development
	- Group approach like JAD
	- Four phase life cycle that parallels the traditional SDLC
	- Reduces cost and developmental time
	- Increases the probability of success
	- Relies on prototyping and user involvement

- JAD 
	- Group
	- Collaboration
	- Roles

- RAD
	- Group
	- Prototyping
	- Save Time 

- AGILE
	- Prototyping 
	- Continuous Feedback
	- 2-week sprints

- Scrum
	- Scrum sessions
		- Rugby - specific guidelines emphasize time blocks, interaction and team based activities
