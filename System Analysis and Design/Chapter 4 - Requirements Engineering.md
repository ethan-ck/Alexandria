# Requirements Representation Techniques
- Gather requirements from users through interviews and questionnaires 
- Review the successful project balance triangle
- Money, Time, and Scope/Quality (Requirements)

## Models
- A conceptual model of some part of the system, not physical 
- Agile
	- Fact-finding plan for gathering requirements
	-

## System Requirements

- Challenges include imprecision, user not described it clear enough
- 

### Functional Requirements
- Services
	- I/O
		- O- Report/list
		- I - inputs
	- security
### Non-Functional Requirements
- Quality Attributes
	- Aesthetics
	- Quantify items 

- Scalability 
	- Ability to handle increased or decreased volume and transactions

- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)


Joint Application Development (JAD)
- Multiple people working together
- ACTIVE ROLES
- FORMAL OR INFORMAL
- Project leader and one or more members


- JAD Advantages and Disadvantages
	- Disadvantages
		- more expensive
		- large groups can be cumbersome
	- Advantages
		- Allows key users to participate effectively
		- Users are more likely to feel a sense of ownership
		- Accurate statement of system requirements

- Rapid Application Development
	- Group approach like JAD
	- Four phase life cycle that parallels the traditional SDLC
	- Reduces cost and developmental time
	- Increases the probability of success
	- Relies on prototyping and user involvement

- JAD 
	- Group
	- Collaboration
	- Roles

- RAD
	- Group
	- Prototyping
	- Save Time 

- AGILE
	- Prototyping 
	- Continuous Feedback
	- 2-week sprints

- Scrum
	- Scrum sessions
		- Rugby - specific guidelines emphasize time blocks, interaction and team based activities 

- Keep note taking to a minimum (test question)


- Sampling 
	- Systematic 
		- Selection of every x customer for review
		- Stratified 
			- Selection of x customers from each x postal codes
		- Random Sample
			- selection of any x
		- Objective of a sample 
			- Ensures it represents the overall population accurately 

- Agile Projects Requirements Gathering 
	- listen to user stories and feedback


- Document stuff


- Natural Language 
	- Unstructured natural language
		- Ex. How does gravity work?


- FDP 
	- Like an organization chart, but from a top-down perspective
	- It's a way to list the different systems or roles
