- Technical Feasibility refers to the practical resources needed to develop, purchase, install, or operate the system

-  Which feasibilities do NOT mean the proposed system will be used effectively after it has been developed.
	- Technical
	- Schedule
	- Economic

- A common reason for systems requests is
	- Improved Services
	- Better performance
	- Reduced cost

- Projects where management has a choice in implementing them are called discretionary projects

- A feasibility study includes tests for economic feasibility, which means that the projected benefits of the proposed system outweigh the estimated costs.

- External factors that affect IT system projects
	- Technology
	- Competitors
	- Suppliers

- Of the measures of feasibility, operational feasibility considers questions such as “Does management support the project?” and “Will the new system require training for users?”

- By questioning users about additional capabilities they would like to have, instead of focusing on difficulties, a systems analyst
	- Gets a better understanding of operations
	- Highlights ways to improve the user's job
	- builds better, more positive relationship with users
	  

- A Preliminary Investigation Report can have which of the following sections:
	- Introduction
	- Recommendations
	- Appendix 

- Electronic data interchange (EDI) enables JIT inventory systems, which rely on computer to computer data exchange to minimize unnecessary inventory

- A systems request form should NOT have complex instructions

- In a preliminary investigation report, the findings section contains the results of the preliminary investigation, including a description of the project's scope, constraints, and feasibility

- Strategic planning is the process of identifying long-term organization goals, strategies, and resources.
  
- Many companies implement CRM system that integrate all customer-related events and transactions

- When using a fishbone diagram to investigate causes of a problem, an analyst first states the problem and then draws a main bone with sub-bones that represent possible causes of the problem
