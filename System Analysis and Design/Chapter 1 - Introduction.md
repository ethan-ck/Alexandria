- Businesses rely on information technology more than over because we're very important to the productivity, efficiency, and other stuff 

- IT is driving a new digital economy, advancing hardware, software, and connectivity which in turn is a huge boon to businesses.

- Systems Analysis and Design is a step by step process for developing high quality information systems.
	- An information system combines technology, people, and data to provide support for business functions.
	- These functions include but are not limited to: order processing, inventory control, human resources, accounting, and more

- A Systems Analyst is a valued member of the IT department team who helps plan, develop, and maintain information systems 
	- Must be business savvy, technically competent, and must be comfortable with managers and programmers with differing views. 
	- Most companies assign them to the IT department, but they can also be assigned to other departments like marketing, sales, or accounting.
	- Document business processes, test hardware/software, design input screens, train users, and plan e-commerce websites.'

- A System is a set of related components that produces specific results
	- Specialists systems that route traffic, manufacture microchips, and control complex entities (Hubble telescope) 

- Mission-Critical System is a system vital to a company's operation
	- Data which consists of basic facts that are the system's raw material. Information is data that has been transformed into output that is valuable to users. 

- Software
	- System software managers the hardware components 
	- Application software consists of programs that support day to day business functions and provide users with the information they need. 
	- Ex of a company-wide applications (Enterprise applications) include order processing systems, payroll systems, and company communications networks.

- Types of Application Software
	- Horizontal Systems - A system that can be adapted for use in many different types of companies (payroll or inventory application) 
	- Vertical Systems - A system designed to meet the unique requirements of a specific business or industry. 
	- Legacy Systems - An older system 

- Enterprise means company-wide

- Business Information Systems 
	- Enterprise computing supports company-wide operations and data management requirements
		- Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems provide cost-effective support for users and managers throughout the company
	- Transaction Processing (TP) Systems process data generated by day to day business operations
		- Customer order processing, accounts receivable, and warranty claim processing
	- Business support systems
		- Provide job-related information support to users at all levels of a company 
			- Management Information Systems (MIS) 
			- Radio frequency identification (RFID)
	- Knowledge Management 
		- Uses a knowledge base and inference rules that allows users to find information by entering keywords.
		- Inference rules identify data patterns and relationships
	- User productive Systems
		- Technology that improves productivity 
		- Groupware enables data sharing
	- Digital Assistants
		- Combinations of knowledge management systems and user productivity systems
	- Systems integration
		- Combination of transaction processing, business support, knowledge management, and user productivity features

- Sales Transaction Breakdown (6 tasks)
	- 1. Verify Customer Data
	- 2. Check Credit Status
	- 3. Check Stock Status
	- 4. Post to Accounts Receivable
	- 5. Adjust Inventory Levels
	- 6. Update Sales File.

- Organization Information Models
	- Functions and organization levels are defined in a typical organization model
	- Top Mangers
		- Develop long-range strategic plans
	- Middle managers and knowledge workers
		- Provide direction, resources, and performance feedback to supervisors and team leaders
		- Knowledge workers provide support for the organization's basic functions

- Organizational Levels are as follows
	- 1. Top Managers
	- 2. Middle Managers and Knowledge Workers
	- 3. Supervisors and Team Leaders
		- Oversee operation employees and carry out day to day functions
	- 4. Operational Employees
		- Rely on TOP systems to enter and receive data, empowered to handle tasks and make decisions that were assigned previously to supervisors

- Business Functions
	- IT, Human Resources, Accounting, Sales, Marketing, and Production 

- Systems Development 
	- Structured Analysis
		- Uses systems developmental life cycle (SDLC) to plan, analyze, design, implement, and support an information system
	- Object-oriented analysis
		- Combines data and processes as objects
	- Agile methods
		- Builds a series of prototypes and constantly adjusts them to user requirements
		- Spiral model

- Prototyping 
	- An early working version of an information system
		- Disadvantage: important decisions might be made before business or IT issues are thoroughly understood
		- Prototypes based on careful fact-finding and modeling techniques can be extremely valuable 

- Computer-Aided Systems Engineering (CASE) tools
	- Computer-aided software engineering
	- Provide an overall framework
	- support design metholodogies 
	- generate program code

- Trends in Information Technology
	- IT is one of the fastest evolving industries, knowledge of current trends is vital
	- Key trends include:
		- Agile methods
		- Cloud computing 
		- Data science
		- Mobile devices
		- Service orientation
		- Social Media

- O-O Model
	- Object-Oriented Analysis
	- Treats processes and data as separate components, which combines data and the processes that act on the data as objects.
	- System analysists use O-O to model real-world business processes and operations
	- Object is a member of a class, which is a collection of similar objects. These objects possess characteristics called properties, in which the object inherits from its class or on its own.
	- Built in processes called methods can change an object's properties. Planning analysis, and design tasks interact to produce prototypes that can be tested and implemented 

- Agile Methods
	- Typically use a spiral model, which represents a series of iterations or revisions based on user feedback. 
	- Each iteration or phase of the model must have a specific goal that is accepted, rejected, or changed by the user or client. 

- Prototyping 
	- Structured analysis, O-O analysis, and agile methods can all employ prototyping as a supporting systems development method. 
	- Prototypes test system concepts and provides an opportunity to examine input, output, and user interfaces before any final decisions are made. 
	- A prototype is an early working version of an information system.
	- Speeds up development significantly

- Tools 
	- All systems development methods must be supported by tools to enable the systems analysist to develop, manage, and maintain large-scale information systems.
	- These tools go by various names including:
		- Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) or Product (PLM)
		- Integrated Development Environments (IDE) 
		- Computer Aided Systems Engineering (CASE)
		- CASE tools provide an overall framework for systems development and support a wide variety of design methodologies, including structured analysis and object-oriented analysis
