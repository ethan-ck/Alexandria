# Project Management

- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
	- An analysis on what the information system is, what it does, everything, then break it down again
	- Workflow

- Planning, Scheduling, Monitoring Controlling, and Reporting on Information System Development
	- Planning and Scheduling are set at the beginning when you initially set up the GANTT chart.
	- Reporting are the important checkpoints or milestones along the way

- SDLC
	- System Development Life Cycle
	- Lion King

- Project Triangle
	- A project triangle includes the cost, scope, and time 
	- A successful project triangle is a well-balanced project triangle :) 
	- SDLC

- Project Manager
	- Planning, all the administrative tasks, resolving conflicts


- Program Evaluation Review Technique
	- Developed by the US Navy
	- bottom-up technique 
	- Displays complex task patterns and relationships

- Critical Path Method (CPM)
	- Developed by private industry
	- If these certain tasks do not get done, the project is in trouble

- Managers must always plan a best-case, probable-case and worst-case estimate for deadlines, milestones, etc...
	- B + 4P + W / 6

- Factors affecting duration
	- Project size + scope
	- Human Resources
		- IT people manpower

- Task Patterns
	- Dependent tasks
		- Completed in a sequence
		- Previous task needs to be completed before this task
	- Multiple successor tasks
		- Tasks that come ONLY after a task is finished
	- Multiple predecessor tasks
		-  Tasks that must be done BEFORE a task opens up

- Complex Task Patterns
	- 

- The Critical Path 
	- A series of tasks that if delayed, will severely impact the completion date of the overall project

- Structured Walk-through
	- Basically claim reviews, ensuring that the task is up to the standards of development
