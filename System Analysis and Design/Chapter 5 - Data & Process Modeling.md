- Data Flow
	- Input, Processing, Output
	- Users live in the output

- Logical and Physical Models
	- Logical
		- Conceptional models or diagrams that are created in the design stage that the user will never see
		- How it will be implemented physically
	- Physical
		- A prototype or physical model that the users will give feedback on
		- How the system will be constructed

- Four basic Design Flow Patterns
	- Context Diagram
	- Diagram 0
	- Lower-Level DFD

- Six guidelines 

- Data Flow Diagram Symbol
	- Rounded Rectangle - Process
		- An action that is being taken in a diagram
	- Data Flow - Line with an Arrow
		- How the data moves within a diagram
	- Data Storage - Flat Rectangle open on the right
		- A Database table
	- Eternal Entity - Shadow Box
		- Shows how the system interfaces with the outside world, also called a terminator 
		- Must go through a process 

- Process Symbols
	- Receives input, produces output
	- Business logic that transforms the data 
	- In DFDs a process symbol can be referred to as a black box

- Incorrect Data Flow
	- Black Hole (Input with no Output)
	- Spontaneous Generation (Output with no Input)
	- Gray hole (Input and Output have no relation.
		- Ex. Input: Birth Date Output: Total Hours Worked)

- Data Dictionary
	- A central storehouse of information about a system's data.
