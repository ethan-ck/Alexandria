- Everything is made up of matter. Matter is defined as anything any takes up space and has mass. 
	- Can exist in several states
		- Gas
		- Solid
		- Liquid
		- Plasma
	- Matter is also composed of elements.
- All matter is composed of Elements. Elements are substances that cannot be broken down into other substances by ordinary chemical means. 
- All elements consist of tiny particles called atoms. 
	- Each element consists of only a single type of atom. So the same name is given to both an element and its atoms.
		- The name is represented by one or two letters, called the atomic symbol.
			- Ex. H stands for an atom of Hydrogen
			- Na stands for an atom of sodium
- All atoms consist of subatomic particles, neutrons, protons, and electrons.
	- Neutrons (Neutral) yield no electrical charge.
	- Protons (Positive) yield a positive charge.
	- Electrons (Negative) yield a negative charge.
	- Neutrons and Protons are located in the center of an atom (the nucleus) while electrons move all around the nucleus. 
- The mass of an atom is called the mass number, and is equal to the sum of its protons and neutrons. 
	- Protons and neutrons are assigned one mass unit each, while electrons are zero units. 
- An atom's atomic number is the number of protons.
	- It essentially tells you the number of positively charged protons. 
- The Atomic mass is the average of the mass numbers for these atoms
	- To be specific, the mass of the protons and neutrons
		- These Radioactive Isotopes are used to track changes and destroy cells (X-rays and chemotherapy)
			- A researcher can thus use a small amount of radioactive isotope as a tracer to detect how a group of cells or an organ is processing a certain element or molecule. 
				- Ex. Giving a person a small amount of idoine-131 to determine if a thyroid gland is functioning properly. 
				- ex. A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) uses tracerse to determine the comparative activity of tissues.
			- Radioactive substances are dangerous and can cause harmful chemical changes in cells, damage DNA, and cause cancer. 
			- They are the same element, but differ in their mass numbers.
			- They are the same element, but differ in the number of neutrons.
	- Isotopes are atoms of the same element that differ in the amount of neutrons
		- They have the same number of protons, but have different mass numbers
		- A radioactive isotope is a nucleus with excess neutrons, which is unstable and decay, and emit radiation. 
		- Geiger counter (Uranium fever)
- The properties of Water:
	- Solvency
	- Cohesion and adhesion
		- Allows water molecules to cling together through hydrogen bonding (cohesion) (water on water)
		- cling to other polar surfaces with adhesion (water on other substances)
		- Enables water to transport both inside and outside of living organisms
		- contributes to water transport in plants
	- High surface tension
	- High heat capacity
	- high heat of vaporization
	- varying density 

- PH Scale and Acidic Solutions 
	- Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions
		- Lemon juice, vinegar, coffee
	- Bases are substances that either take up hydrogen ions or release hydroxide ions 
		- Milk of magnesia and ammonia
	- The PH scale is a mathematical way to indicate the number of hydrogen ions in a solution
		- PH scale ranges form 0 to 14.
			- PH below 7 is acidic (More H+ than 0H-)
			- PH above 7 is basic (More 0H- than H+) (White girls)
			- PH of 7 is neutral (equal amounts of both)
			- 
	- Buffers are chemical or combination of chemicals that keep PH within normal limits, it resist the PH change by taking up excess H+ or 0H-
	- Blood is maintained by a buffer
	- Acidosis

- atoms with only one shell are complete when they have two electrons in it 
- covalent bonds involves sharing of electrons between atoms, while 

- When a molecule contains atoms of more than one element, it is called a compound
- The number of electrons in an atoms outer shell is called the valence shell and determines its chemical reactivity 
- An ionic bond forms when two atoms are held together by the attraction between opposite charges
- ions are charged atoms 
- covalent bonding results when two atoms hare electrons in order to have a completed outer shell 
- In a chemical equation with the arrow pointing to the right, the left side contains the reactants 
- Hydrogen bonds are when the positive hydrogen atoms in one molecule are attracted to the negative oxygen atoms in other water molecules. 
- A polar covalent bonds, the atoms on either side are partially charged because of their unequal electronegativity.
