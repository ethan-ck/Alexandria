- Everything is made up of matter. Matter is defined as anything any takes up space and has mass. 
	- Can exist in several states
		- Gas
		- Solid
		- Liquid
		- Plasma
	- Matter is also composed of elements.
- All matter is composed of Elements. Elements are substances that cannot be broken down into other substances by ordinary chemical means. 
- All elements consist of tiny particles called atoms. 
	- Each element consists of only a single type of atom. So the same name is given to both an element and its atoms.
		- The name is represented by one or two letters, called the atomic symbol.
			- Ex. H stands for an atom of Hydrogen
			- Na stands for an atom of sodium
- All atoms consist of subatomic particles, neutrons, protons, and electrons.
	- Neutrons (Neutral) yield no electrical charge.
	- Protons (Positive) yield a positive charge.
	- Electrons (Negative) yield a negative charge.
	- Neutrons and Protons are located in the center of an atom (the nucleus) while electrons move all around the nucleus. 
- The mass of an atom is called the mass number, and is equal to the sum of its protons and neutrons. 
	- Protons and neutrons are assigned one mass unit each, while electrons are zero units. 
- An atom's atomic number is the number of protons.
	- It essentially tells you the number of postively charged protons. 
- The Atomic mass is the average of the mass numbers for these atoms
	- To be specific, the mass of the protons and neutrons
	- Isotopes are atoms of the same element that differ in the amount of neutrons
		- They have the same number of protons, but have different mass numbers
		- A radioactive isotope is a nucleus with excess neutrons, which is unstable and decay, and emit radiation. 
		- Geiger counter (Uranium fever)
- These Radioactive Isotopes are used to track changes and destroy cells (X-rays and chemotherapy)
	- A researcher can thus use a small amount of radioactive isotope as a tracer to detect how a group of cells or an organ is processing a certain element or molecule. 
		- Ex. Giving a person a small amount of idoine-131 to determine if a thyroid gland is functioning properly. 
		- ex. A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) uses tracerse to determine the comparative activity of tissues.
	- Radioactive substances are dangerous and can cause harmful chemical changes in cells, damage DNA, and cause cancer. 
- The properties of Water:
	- Solvency
	- Cohesion and adhesion
	- High surface tension
	- High heat capacity
	- high heat of vaporization
	- varying density 

- PH Scale and Acidic Solutions 
	- Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions
		- Lemon juice, vinegar, coffee
	- Bases are substances that either take up hydrogen ions or release hydroxide ions 
		- Milk of magnesia and ammonia
	- The PH scale is a mathematical way to indicate the number
