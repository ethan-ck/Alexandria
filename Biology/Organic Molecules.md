Organic Chemistry focuses on the molecules that build living things, specifically the molecules containing carbon and hydrogen. 

- The Carbon Atom 
	- Hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are elements that a carbon atom shares electrons to complete its outer shell
	- Molecules with different strcutures but the same combi

- Gluten
	- Gluten is a type of protein
	- Found in Wheat, rye and barley 
	- Celiac disease is a disorder involving the body identifying gluten as a foreign pathogen. 
- 4 Groups of Molecules
	- Carbs
	- Proteins
	- Lipids
	- Nucleic Acids

- Our bodies NEED these molecules to function, it is also essential to understand these molecules or "building blocks" to see how we function.

- Basic Terminology used in Organic Chemistry
	- Macromolecules 
		- Big 
		- Made up of hundreds of atoms
		- Also called biomolecules, as they are the "life molecules"
	- Breaking down Macromolecules
		- They are considered a Polymer 
			- Poly = many Mer = parts 
				- Polymers can be broken down into monomers
			- Building blocks 
		- Polymer and Monomers are just generic terms that can be modified to explain the molecules in the 4 groups.
			- An example being in "Carbs", carbs consist of Polysaccharides, which break down into Monosaccharides. 
		- Poly, Tri, Mono, oh my 
	- Monomers
		- Has H(ydrogen) on one side with a HO(Hydorgen-oxide) on another side
		- With two monomers, they combine together to form H20.
	- Dehydration Synthesis 
		- Synthesis refers to building or making something
		- Dehydration refers to remove/lose water
		- Dehydration Synthesis is the action of losing water
		- All Macromolecules are built using this same process
		- Adding back in the water will break the bond, and revert the two monomers back to their original form 
	- Hydrolysis
		- Hydro = water (duh)
		- lysis = to break 
		- BREAK THE WATER
