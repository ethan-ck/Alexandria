Organic Chemistry focuses on the molecules that build living things, specifically the molecules containing carbon and hydrogen. 

- The Carbon Atom 
	- Hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are elements that a carbon atom shares electrons to complete its outer shell
	- Molecules with different structures but the same combination of atoms are called isomers 
	- CO2 lacks hydrogen 

- The Carbon  Skeleton and Functional Groups
	- A carbon chain of an organic molecule is called its skeleton/backbone
	- A functional group is a specific combination of bonded atoms that always has the same chemical properties. 
	- Functional Groups are recognized by the letter R
	- There are several Functional Groups
		- Hydroxyl 
			- Found in Alcohols and sugars
		- Carboxyl -COOH
			- Found in Amino acids and fatty acids
		- Amino 
			- Amino acids and proteins
		- Sulfhydryl -SH
			- Amina acids, cysteine and proteins
		- Phosphate 
			- ATP (Energy), nucleic acids 

- 4 Groups of Molecules
	- Carbs
		- The immediate energy source 
		- For plants and fungi, they are used in structural functions
			- Cellulose 
		- Bread, Corn, rice, pasta, potatoes 
		- Exist as saccharides (sugar) 
		- Monosaccharides, Disaccharide, polysaccharide 
		- Simple sugars have a breakdown of 3 to 7 
		- They may exist as a saccharide (Sugar) monomer or as polymers of these said saccharides 
		- animals store glucose in a polysaccharide called glycogen
			- Polysaccharides are an ideal short term energy storage molecule as they are quite large and insoluble.
			- The most abundant polysaccharide in nature is cellulose
	- Proteins
		- Gluten
			- Gluten is a type of protein
			- Found in Wheat, rye and barley 
			- Celiac disease is a disorder involving the body identifying gluten as a foreign pathogen. 

	- Lipids
		- Biological molecules such as fats, oils, and waxes. 
		- All lipids are insoluble in water 
		- In order to form a fatty acid, a carboxyl group at one end of the chain of carbon must be present 
		- Fats protect internal organs and provide insulation 
		- Fats and oils are formed during a dehydration synthesis reaction
		- Plants use oils as a long term energy storage 
		- Saturated fatty acids has a hydrogen atom at every possible place along its carbon chain 
		- Triglycerides serve as a high energy storage molecule 
		- Steroids have a molecular skeleton made of four fused carbon rings 
		- Phospholipids have a glycerol backbone,, a phosphate group, and two fatty acids 
	- Nucleic Acids
		- Form our genetic material 
	

- Basic Terminology used in Organic Chemistry
	- Macromolecules 
		- Big 
		- Made up of hundreds of atoms
		- Also called biomolecules, as they are the "life molecules"
	- Breaking down Macromolecules
		- They are considered a Polymer 
			- Poly = many Mer = parts 
				- Polymers can be broken down into monomers
			- Building blocks 
		- Polymer and Monomers are just generic terms that can be modified to explain the molecules in the 4 groups.
			- An example being in "Carbs", carbs consist of Polysaccharides, which break down into Monosaccharides. 
		- Poly, Tri, Mono, oh my 
	- Monomers
		- Has H(ydrogen) on one side with a HO(Hydorgen-oxide) on another side
		- With two monomers, they combine together to form H20.
	- Dehydration Synthesis 
		- Synthesis refers to building or making something
		- Dehydration refers to remove/lose water
		- Dehydration Synthesis is the action of losing water
		- All Macromolecules are built using this same process
		- Adding back in the water will break the bond, and revert the two monomers back to their original form 
	- Hydrolysis
		- Hydro = water (duh)
		- lysis = to break 
		- BREAK THE WATER
