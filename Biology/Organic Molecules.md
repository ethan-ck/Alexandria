Organic Chemistry focuses on the molecules that build living things, specifically the molecules containing carbon and hydrogen. 

- The Carbon Atom 
	- Hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are elements that a carbon atom shares electrons to complete its outer shell
	- Molecules with different structures but the same combination of atoms are called isomers 
	- CO2 lacks hydrogen 

- The Carbon  Skeleton and Functional Groups
	- A carbon chain of an organic molecule is called its skeleton/backbone
	- A functional group is a specific combination of bonded atoms that always has the same chemical properties. 
	- Functional Groups are recognized by the letter R
	- There are several Functional Groups
		- Hydroxyl 
			- Found in Alcohols and sugars
		- Carboxyl -COOH
			- Found in Amino acids and fatty acids
		- Amino 
			- Amino acids and proteins
		- Sulfhydryl -SH
			- Amina acids, cysteine and proteins
		- Phosphate 
			- ATP (Energy), nucleic acids 

- 4 Groups of Molecules
	- Carbs
		- The immediate energy source 
		- For plants and fungi, they are used in structural functions
			- Cellulose 
		- Bread, Corn, rice, pasta, potatoes 
		- Exist as saccharides (sugar) 
		- Monosaccharides, Disaccharide, polysaccharide 
		- Simple sugars have a breakdown of 3 to 7 
		- They may exist as a saccharide (Sugar) monomer or as polymers of these said saccharides 
		- animals store glucose in a polysaccharide called glycogen
			- Polysaccharides are an ideal short term energy storage molecule as they are quite large and insoluble.
			- The most abundant polysaccharide in nature is cellulose
	- Proteins
		- The building block (monomers) of proteins are amino acids
			- amino groups and an acid group 
			- When multiple amino acids join together, they form a polypeptide 
			- They join together through dehydration reactions 
		- Like lipids, they are insoluble in water 
		- Gluten
			- Gluten is a type of protein
			- Found in Wheat, rye and barley 
			- Celiac disease is a disorder involving the body identifying gluten as a foreign pathogen. 
		- Primary importance in the structure and function of cells
			- Support: Structural proteins ex include keratin, collagen, and the protein in spiderwebs 
			- Metabolism 
				- Something about enzymes lol idk and transporting stuff catalysts 
		- Proteins also act as carriers or channels within cell membranes, make motion possible, and help defend the body against diseases
		- Peptides are formed when two amino acids are joined by a dehydration synthesis reaction between the carboxyl group and the amino group of another 
		- There are 20 different amino acids,w hich differ by their R group
			- R groups range in complexity from a single hdyrogen atom to a complicated ring strcuture
			- Some R groups are polar, some are charged, and some are hydrophobic 
			- 
	- Protein Structures
		- Primary structure 
			- Linear sequence of amino acid monomers in a single polypeptide chain
				- Is the basis for all the subsequent levels of structure
			- Secondary Structure
				- Substructure that results from hydrogen bonds between amino acids 
					- Helices (fancy name for coils) sheets, and loops
					- A single polypeptide can have multiple of the things mentioned above 
				- Tertiary Structure 
					- Final 3D shape of a single polypeptide chain
						- Globular shape (fake news) due to various types of bonding between amino acid R groups
							- Covalent, ionic, and hydrogen bonds
						- There are hydrophobic (nonpolar) regions towards the center
					- Quaternary Structure
						- Two or more folded polypeptides integrated together to form a functional protein 
							- Only found in proteins that consist of multiple polypeptides 

	- Lipids
		- Biological molecules such as fats, oils, and waxes. 
		- All lipids are insoluble in water 
		- In order to form a fatty acid, a carboxyl group at one end of the chain of carbon must be present 
		- Fats protect internal organs and provide insulation 
		- Fats and oils are formed during a dehydration synthesis reaction
		- Plants use oils as a long term energy storage 
		- Saturated fatty acids has a hydrogen atom at every possible place along its carbon chain 
		- Triglycerides serve as a high energy storage molecule 
		- Steroids have a molecular skeleton made of four fused carbon rings 
		- Phospholipids have a glycerol backbone, a phosphate group, and two fatty acids 
		- Cholesterol is a component of an animal cell's plasma membrane and is a precursor of steroids (Testosterone and estrogen)
		- Fatty acids that contains double bonded carbon atoms are unsaturated fatty acids 
	- Nucleic Acids
		- Form our genetic material 
	

- Basic Terminology used in Organic Chemistry
	- Macromolecules 
		- Big 
		- Made up of hundreds of atoms
		- Also called biomolecules, as they are the "life molecules"
	- Breaking down Macromolecules
		- They are considered a Polymer 
			- Poly = many Mer = parts 
				- Polymers can be broken down into monomers
			- Building blocks 
		- Polymer and Monomers are just generic terms that can be modified to explain the molecules in the 4 groups.
			- An example being in "Carbs", carbs consist of Polysaccharides, which break down into Monosaccharides. 
		- Poly, Tri, Mono, oh my 
	- Monomers
		- Has H(ydrogen) on one side with a HO(Hydorgen-oxide) on another side
		- With two monomers, they combine together to form H20.
	- Dehydration Synthesis 
		- Synthesis refers to building or making something
		- Dehydration refers to remove/lose water
		- Dehydration Synthesis is the action of losing water
		- All Macromolecules are built using this same process
		- Adding back in the water will break the bond, and revert the two monomers back to their original form 
	- Hydrolysis
		- Hydro = water (duh)
		- lysis = to break 
		- BREAK THE WATER
