- Photosynthetic Process
	- The equation, what goes in and what goes out
	- Photosynthesis uses light energy and Co2 from the air, and water to create glucose and release oxygen as a byproduct
		- ATP + CO2 + Water = Glucose + O2
	- The chloroplast does this process in a whole series of steps
	- Can be broken down into two reactions
		- Light Reactions
			- Thylakoids creates increased surface area so that light reactions can take place
			- They use a light-transport chain to harness the energy from the sun 
			- So a lot of membrane = more energy absorbed
			- Electron Transport Chains
				- Used in both chloroplasts and mitochondria 
				- Is a series of proteins that transports an electron, in which these electrons have HIGH energy. As the electrons pass from protein from protein, each protein takes energy from the electron. 
				- Pumps protons/hydrogen ion (H+)
				- The energy from the electron is used to pump protons from the proteins
				- A pump requires energy, it creates a high concentration on one side of the membrane. 
				- H+ water wheel kinetic energy stuff, the ATP synthas does this stuff, spinning the bottom of the enzyme like a wheel 
				- Water is oxidized, releasing electrons, hydrogen ions and oxygen
				- ATP produced int he electron transport chain 
				- NADP+ -> NADPH
		- Calvin (Dark) Reactions
			- Occurs in the stroma 
			- CO2 is taken up 
			- ATP and NADPH are used to reduce CO2 to a carbohydrate 
	- Photosynthesis occurs in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. They are called producers because they feed themselves and all of the consumes (which are most of other living organisms on Earth) 
	- Photosynthetic Organisms are called autotrophs or producers 
	- The green portions on leaves carry the process of photosynthesis
		- The Carbon dioxide enters leaves through the stomata
		- The roots absorb water
		- CO2 and H2O diffuse into the mesophyll cells, then into the chloroplasts 
	- The Chloroplast
		- It is a double membrane surrounding the stroma
		- The third membrane forms thylakoids
			- Grana - means stacks basically
			- Thylakoid space, remember that this expands the surface area of the cell, more area = more energy adsorbed 
		- Chlorophyll and other pigments reside within thylakoid membrane
			- These pigments adsorb solar energy
			- The CO2 will be reduced in the stroma into carbohydrates
			- glucose is the chief organic energy source for most organisms 

- The actual process
	- Begins with the end products of celluylar respiration, CO2 and H2O
	- Hydrogen atoms removed from the water are added to carbon dioxide 
		- Solar energy is required for this step
	- Oxygen is a by-product of the oxidation of water
	- The end product is CH2O or glucose C6H12O6
