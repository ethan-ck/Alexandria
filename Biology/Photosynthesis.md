- Photosynthetic Process
	- The equation, what goes in and what goes out
	- Photosynthesis uses light energy and Co2 from the air, and water to create glucose and release oxygen as a byproduct
		- ATP + CO2 + Water = Glucose + O2
	- The chloroplast does this process in a whole series of steps
	- Can be broken down into two reactions
		- Light Reactions
			- Thylakoids creates increased surface area so that light reactions can take place
			- They use a light-transport chain to harness the energy from the sun 
			- So a lot of membrane = more energy absorbed
			- Electron Transport Chains
				- Used in both chloroplasts and mitochondria 
				- Is a series of proteins that transports an electron, in which these electrons have HIGH energy. As the electrons pass from protein from protein, each protein takes energy from the electron. 
				- Pumps protons/hydrogen ion (H+)
				- The energy from the electron is used to pump protons from the proteins
				- A pump requires energy, it creates a high concentration on one side of the membrane. 
				- H+ water wheel kinetic energy stuff, the ATP synthas does this stuff, spinning the bottom of the enzyme like a wheel

		- Calvin (Dark) Reactions
	- Photosynthesis occurs in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. They are called producers because they feed themselves and all of the consumes (which are most of other living organisms on Earth) 
	- Photosynthetic Organisms are called autotrophs or producers
