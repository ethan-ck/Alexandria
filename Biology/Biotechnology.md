- Biotechnology is the use of natural biological systems to create a product or achieve some other end desired by humans 

	- Through genetic engineering, we can insert cloned genes into an organism 
- Transgenic organism or GMO
- Cloning genes, which makes identical copies
- Since the genetic code is nearly universal, it is possible to transfer cloned genes between virtually any organism



- Recombinant DNA Technology
	- rDNA contains DNA from two or more different organisms
	- A vector is used to carry the foreign DNA
		- It could be a plasmid from bacteria

	- Restriction enzymes are molecular scissors, they cut DNA at specific sites 
	- These are referred to as "the sticky ends"

	- DNA ligase is used to join pieces of DNA together

	- Human insulin is made by bacterial cells
		- The process is as follows
			- Human gene removed
			- Gene is inserted into plasmid
			- Plasmid is inserted into bacteria
			- bacteria produces insulin as if it were one of their own gene products

- Polymerase E Chain Reaction (PCR)
	- The PCR amplifies specific DNA sequences
	- the DNA polymerase makes DNA
		- Thermus aquaticus - tolerates high temperatures
	- Primers are the specific DNA segment to be amplified, note that it doesn't amplify all DNA, just the target 
	- Cycles over and over again, doubling amount of DNA at each cycle

- DNA Analysis
	- DNA fingerprinting is the use of repeating noncoding DNA segments
	- Every one's segment differ
	- Through PCR, we can increase the amount of DNA sample to identify the person
	- Electrophoresis separates samples by size 
		- Longer DNA strands are larger and migrate less on the gel

- Genome Editing 
	- Targets specific sequences of DNA for removal or replacement
	- The process acts as a molecular scissors to insert new nucleotides at specific DNA locations
	- CRISPR 
		- Discovered in prokaryotes as a viral defense mechanism
		- CAS9, an endonuclease enzyme, identifies specific portion to be cut
		- A sequence called PAM must be adjacent to target NDA for process to be successful
