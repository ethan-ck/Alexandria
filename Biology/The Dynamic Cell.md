- Three basic requirements for the cell to function
	- Energy
		- The energy source is for ATP, Adenosine Tri-Phosphate
		- High energy molecule that when it breaks off the third phosphate, it releases energy for the cell
		- ATP is a renewing energy resource 
			- We Start with ADP (Di-phosphate)
			- When we add a third phosphate, it converts to a tri-phosphate
			- We need some input of energy to add a third phosphate to ADP
			- When the body needs energy, they break off the third phosphate, which changes it back into ADP 
	- Enzymes 
		- All the energy things that happen in the cell require catalysts, this is where enzymes come into play, they speed up the process of ATP generation
		- They are a biological catalyst, meaning that they are present in biological organism
		- (proteins dawg)
		- Shape is important as they can completely change how the protein functions
		- They have an active site which is a very specific site, it is where a different molecule can bond to that specific enzyme. 
		- The other molecule is known as a substrate, and it is a perfect fit to the enzyme. When the two are combined, it forms a specific action. (building or breaking reaction)
		- The enzyme lowers the activation energy 
	- Cell Transport 
		- Involves the movement of the materials (substrates, enzymes, etc...) inside and outside the cell
		- Cells are like factories, they are taking things in and processing things
		- We can break down cell transport into two categories:
		- Passive
			- The cell does not require any energy (ATP) to transport
			- These particles are moving from high concentration to an area of low concentration
			- 
		- Active
			- The cell has to use energy to transport
