- DNA is a nucleic acid that is made up of monomers (building blocks) called nucleotides
- Nucleotides are made up of three 
	- Phosphate Group
	- Sugar
		- For DNA, it is Dioxide Ribose
		- For RNA, it is Ribose
	- Nitrogenous Base (Changes to make 4 different nucleotides)
		- For DNA, it can be Adenine, Guanine, Thymine and Cytosine
		- For RNA it can be Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Uracil 

- These nucleotides bond together to form a chain, creating unique shapes
	- In DNA, it forms the double-helix (the hydrogen bonds in the middle are very weak) 
	- The weak bonds allow the strands to separate

- A T and G C, (Remember that the only word that can be formed is AT)

- Semi-Conservative Module (Half-old, Half-new)
	- DNA is replicated through a process where the two strands are separated from one another
	

- Helicase is in charge of unwinding the helix
	- Remember that anything ending in -ase is an enzyme 

- Primate enzymes that prime the reaction (get ready)

- DNA Polymerase is an enzyme that continues this process using the base-pairing rules

- The leading strand leap frog that ends with fragments called okosoki fragments 

- Protein synthesis is continuing to happen in the background throughout this process. 

- This DNA codes for protein in a two-step process
	- Transcription - Copies the DNA into RNA 
		- DNA is stuck inside the nucleus, RNA can leave the nucleus through the pores in the nuclear membrane to go into the cytoplasm. DNA cannot be damaged, if it does we're FUCKED
		- RNA is a photo-copy, it's okay if it gets damaged 
		- The ribosomes (protein factories) are in the cytoplasm
		- Transcription creates a photo copy of the DNA in mRNA to allow the RNA to go into the cytoplasm 
	- Splicing 
		- This removes the sections known as "introns" that don't code for anything. "Exons" stay in the RNA and exit the nucleus 
		- Some cells do alternative splicing, sometimes they leave certain introns in there and leave exons to create different stuff. They're dynamic 
	- Translation 
		- Takes Nucleic Acid and translates it into Amino acids
		- Needs 3 types of RNA 
			- Riboose Su
