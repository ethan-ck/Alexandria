# Interfaces

	- GUI
	- CLI

# Shell Commands

- Dollar signs in Linux are variables 
	- ex. $PATH is a variable stored in the path
	- The path is nothing more than a list of directories that the OS will look to store executables 
	- Linux looks in the current PATH when running commands, NOT the current directory
- Options for Running Executables
	- Full path
	- Switch to the directory and use ./ (current directory)
	- Add directory to the PATH environment variable 
	- You can move the file into the current path variable
