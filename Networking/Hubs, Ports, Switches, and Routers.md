- Hub is a dumb device (Physical Layer 1), it basically just puts the signal out there.
	- They're evil because they have no identifier, they just send it to everybody and anybody
		- poor performance (splits bandwidth) and security issue
		- "Kid with no filter example"
	- lives in layer 1 
	- repeater 
- Routers connect different Networks
	- Router outside of the LAN is known as the default gateway 
- Managed vs Unmanaged Switch
	- Managed Switches allow you to tweak the settings
	- Unmanaged is plug and play 
- ISDN is a WLAN technology 
	- Don't worry about it rn (telephone type technology)
- Uplink Port/WAN Port 

- Network Adapters (NIC Cards)
	- In addition to Ethernet, you can have a WiFi connection (WAP)
	- Modem converts analog to digital 
	- Modulation/Demodulation
		- Analog is a wave (Phone or voice)
		- Digital is also a wave(but digital wow square wave 1,0,1,0,1,0)
- Transceivers
	- Translates 1 and 0's into + and - charges
	- Layer 1 only
	- it's inside the NIC card
	- SFP
		- Small Form Factor
	- GBIC 
		- Giga Bit Interface Converter
	- QSFP
		- Quad SFP
		- compact, "hot-pluggable"
	- Bi Di (Bidirectional) transceiver
- MAC Address on the NIC card
	- 48-Bit Address = 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits
	- 1st half is the manufacturer (first 3 pairs)
	- 2nd half is the device (last 3 pairs)
- Address Resolution Protocol
	- Have IP address, need MAC address
	-  Lives on Layer 3 
	- 1. Broadcasts address (all F's) as Destination MAC
		- Forces NIC to process
	- 2. Devices with MAC matching IP respond
	- 3. Device stores MAC in ARP table
		- Sends packet with correct destination AMC 
	- RARP is the Reverse ARP, it is used for MAC to IP 
- Hubs
	- Essential just repeaters
	- Lives in layer 1
	- See above for more information 
- Bridge 
	- Layer 2 
	- It's an in-between a Hub and switch
	- It splits the LAN into 2 halves, creating 2 separate broadcast domains 
	- Reduces issue in half 
	- A gatekeeper
