- Check the subnet mask 
	- For example, there are four computers
		- 192.168.1.1
		- 192.168.1.2
		- 192.168.1.3
			- These three 
		- 192.168.2.1 - This one would be on a different subnet 255.255.255.0 
- Default Gateway
	- ARP broadcast to determine proper destination
	- If the computer is on another network, the packet gets sent to the default gateway
	- if the default gateway is misconfigured, the packet fails to send 
		- The switch uses the CAM table to find the correct MAC address, if it doesn't find the correct matchup, the switch sends it to the default gateway.

- DHCP issues
- Improper IP configuration

- Command line tools
	- ipconfig
	- ping
	- tracer
