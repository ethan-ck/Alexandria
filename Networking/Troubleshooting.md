*Chapter 2 and 3 exams are in test out, but they are in assignment/assessment to get information about the exam itself. *

- Copper Wiring Troubleshooting 
	- Interference (EMI)
		- The Wires get zapped (zap zap)
	- Crosstalk
		- Wire intercepts another wire 
		- Near end crosstalk (NEXT)
			- Same connector on different wires
		- Far end crosstalk
			- Same connector on opposite ends 
		- Alien crosstalk 
			-  crosses over to a separate paralcrosstalk
		- To minimize crosstalk
			- Wire them properly
			- Maintain twists right up to the connectors on both ends
			- tight like a tiger
		- Attenuation
			- Loss of signal strength over distance
			- longer cable = more Attenuation 
			- UTP has a limit of 100 meters (328 ft.)
		- impedence Mismatch
			- Impedance is the measure of resistance 
			- Like friction in the wire
			- Occurs when wires have different impedance ratings 
		- Shorts
			- Takes a different path than intended 
			- alternative path gives the electricity a new path that has less resistance
		- Connectors are mismatched
			- User error (reversal)
		- Wire mapping 
		- Split Pair
			- occurs when two pins on one wire are crossed
