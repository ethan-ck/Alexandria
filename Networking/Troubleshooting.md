*Chapter 2 and 3 exams are in test out, but they are in assignment/assessment to get information about the exam itself. *

- Copper Wiring Troubleshooting 
	- Interference (EMI)
		- The Wires get zapped (zap zap)
	- Crosstalk
		- Wire intercepts another wire 
		- Near end crosstalk (NEXT)
			- Same connector on different wires
		- Far end crosstalk
			- Same connector on opposite ends 
		- Alien crosstalk 
			-  crosses over to a separate paralcrosstalk
		- To minimize crosstalk
			- Wire them properly
			- Maintain twists right up to the connectors on both ends
			- tight like a tiger
		- Attenuation
			- Loss of signal strength over distance
			- longer cable = more Attenuation 
			- UTP has a limit of 100 meters (328 ft.)
		- impedence Mismatch
			- Impedance is the measure of resistance 
			- Like friction in the wire
			- Occurs when wires have different impedance ratings 
		- Shorts
			- Takes a different path than intended 
			- alternative path gives the electricity a new path that has less resistance
		- Connectors are mismatched
			- User error (reversal)
		- Wire mapping 
		- Split Pair
			- occurs when two pins on one wire are crossed

- Fiber Optic Troubleshooting 
	- Connector Issues
		- Mismatched connector 
		- fiber needs to line up with the connector
		- dirty connector 
			- Alcohol wipes
			- special cleaning sticks
		- Polishing
			- insertion loss, light is lost 
			- Optical return loss (ORL)
			- Polishing Rating
				- Physical Contact (PC)
				- Super Physical Contact
				- Ultra Physical contact
				- Angled Physical Contact
		- Cable Connector Issues
			- Fragile/Don't bend it
			- Wavelength mismatch 
				- Single mode to multimode
				- Different diameters
			- Media Adapters
				- GBIC, use correct type of fiber optic for the adapter
				- Adapter modules usually go bad
			- Signal Loss
				- Attenuation
					- Cable length
					- connectors
					- splices
					- Loss budget
						- Leak loss margin = less than 3 dB of recommended
