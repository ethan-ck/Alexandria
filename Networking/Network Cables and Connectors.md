Wired and Wireless (Chap 9)

For Wired, there are 3 main cables 

1. Twisted Pair (UTP/STP)
2. Coaxial 
3. Fiber Optic 

Twisted Pair: 

U is for unshielded, which is widely used and supported

Twisted pair is exactly as it sounds, 8 pairs of individual wire twisted together in pairs 

Crosstalk - Occurs with twisted pair, interferes with data 

Electric Magnetic Interference 

The FBI is using Twisted Pair to watch me 

STP - Shielded TP 
Extra cost, used mainly to counter EMI 
Needed in manufacturing with electrical motors 
Has a drain wire - special grounding wire 

Plenum and Riser 

Plenum is the empty space above a dropped ceiling or raised floor

- Fire can spread rapidly in these areas, so plenum rated cables must be installed in these areas
- They are flame retardant (respectfully)

TP Wire Types 
Solid -
- Conducts signal better, but prone to breaks if bent repeatedly 
- best for permanent installation

Stranded 
- More flexible 
- better for frequently moved cables
- for wall plates and patch panels
