Wired and Wireless (Chap 9)

For Wired, there are 3 main cables 

1. Twisted Pair (UTP/STP)
2. Coaxial 
3. Fiber Optic 

Twisted Pair: 

U is for unshielded, which is widely used and supported

Twisted pair is exactly as it sounds, 8 pairs of individual wire twisted together in pairs 

Crosstalk - Occurs with twisted pair, interferes with data 

Electric Magnetic Interference 

The FBI is using Twisted Pair to watch me 

STP - Shielded TP 
Extra cost, used mainly to counter EMI 
Needed in manufacturing with electrical motors 
Has a drain wire - special grounding wire 

Plenum and Riser 

Plenum is the empty space above a dropped ceiling or raised floor

- Fire can spread rapidly in these areas, so plenum rated cables must be installed in these areas
- They are flame retardant (respectfully)

TP Wire Types 
Solid -
- Conducts signal better, but prone to breaks if bent repeatedly 
- best for permanent installation

Stranded 
- More flexible 
- better for frequently moved cables
- for wall plates and patch panels 

UTP Categories

Lower the number, the earlier technology and features available 
Speed and distance 

Cat 3 is old and in the retirement home
Cat 4 never existed (Big tech is lying to you)
Cat 5 is 4x the improvement of cat 3 
Cat 5e - lessens crosstalk and other stuff, also faster
Cat 6 - Speed, also backwards compatible with all the stuff 
Cat 6a - improvement (wow) - not backwards compatible (cringe) 
Cat 7 - shielded and two new connectors also 10gig (speed) (not backwards compatible, the Playstation of categories)

Once again, the higher the cats, faster and better it is 


UTP Connectors 

RJ11 - phone lines (DSL (lol) router to phone)

Coaxial Cable 

- one wire, infinite blah blah blah
- cable 
- old, no one wants it anymore 
- Bus (in) topologies

Topologies (LAN)
