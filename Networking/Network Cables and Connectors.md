Wired and Wireless (Chap 9)

1. Twisted Pair (UTP/STP)
2. Coaxial 
3. Fiber Optic 

Twisted Pair: 

U is for unshielded, which is widely used and supported

Twisted pair is exactly as it sounds, 8 pairs of individual wire twisted together in pairs 

Crosstalk - Occurs with twisted pair, interferes with data 

Electric Magnetic Interference
