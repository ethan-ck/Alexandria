Wired and Wireless (Chap 9)

For Wired, there are 3 main cables 

1. Twisted Pair (UTP/STP)
2. Coaxial 
3. Fiber Optic 

Twisted Pair: 

U is for unshielded, which is widely used and supported

Twisted pair is exactly as it sounds, 8 pairs of individual wire twisted together in pairs 

Crosstalk - Occurs with twisted pair, interferes with data 

Electric Magnetic Interference 

The FBI is using Twisted Pair to watch me 

STP - Shielded TP 
Extra cost, used mainly to counter EMI 
Needed in manufacturing with electrical motors 
Has a drain wire - special grounding wire 

Plenum and Riser 

Plenum is the empty space above a dropped ceiling or raised floor

- Fire can spread rapidly in these areas, so plenum rated cables must be installed in these areas
- They are flame retardant (respectfully)

TP Wire Types 
Solid -
- Conducts signal better, but prone to breaks if bent repeatedly 
- best for permanent installation

Stranded 
- More flexible 
- better for frequently moved cables
- for wall plates and patch panels 

UTP Categories

Lower the number, the earlier technology and features available 
Speed and distance 

Cat 3 is old and in the retirement home
Cat 4 never existed (Big tech is lying to you)
Cat 5 is 4x the improvement of cat 3 
Cat 5e - lessens crosstalk and other stuff, also faster
Cat 6 - Speed, also backwards compatible with all the stuff 
Cat 6a - improvement (wow) - not backwards compatible (cringe) 
Cat 7 - shielded and two new connectors also 10gig (speed) (not backwards compatible, the Playstation of categories)

Once again, the higher the cats, faster and better it is 


UTP Connectors 

RJ11 - phone lines (DSL (lol) router to phone)

Coaxial Cable 

- one wire, infinite blah blah blah
- cable 
- old, no one wants it anymore 
- Bus (in) topologies
- THICK (god damn)
- not modern, expensive

Fiber Optic Cable 
- Let there be light 
-  expensive and hard to work with 

SMF (Single Mode)
- Faster and goes longer
- single (duh) 
- Very thin, thinner than a strand of hair (it's shy, don't bully its size)
- 10 Gbs for 40 Km 
MMF(Multi Mode Fiber)
- not as fast and shorter
- Multiple signals 
- Thicker than SMF
- Shorter Distances, Lower speeds
- 

Topologies (LAN)

1. Ring (Christmas lights, all connected to one another)
2. Bus (starts literally a line, with branching connections, think of a hallway with rooms on each side.)
3. Star (If one pc goes down, it doesn't break the connection, all PCs connect to the middle, its the BOSS)
4. hybrid (boring)
5. Mesh (clusterfuck but reliable)
