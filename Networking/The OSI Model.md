The Open Systems Interconnection, or OSI for short, is a model that is designed to standardize the functions for a telecommunication system. 

**All People Seem To Need Data Processing** 

- The OSI Model has 7 layers:
	- Application -
		- This layer is the final layer, and is the closet to the user, it integrates the Network services with the Operating system through the use of the protocols below/ 
		- Has Multiple Protocols
			- HTTP 
			- FTP
			- SMTP
			- DNS
			- DHCP
	- Presentation 
		- Once a session is established, it must "present" the data in a clean and efficient way. This layer handles the formatting, encryption, and compression of data. 
	- Session 
		- Establishes a session between two or more devices with a Session-ID 
	- Transport 
		- Allows for the flow of Data through controls 
		- Think of a log going down the river with multiple gates. 
		- PORTS Live here
		- Has two Protocols 
			- TCP 
			- UDP - 
		- The PDUs in this layer are called Segments 
	- Network - Routes Data over Network
		- IP Address 
		- Devices include a Router 
		-  Two Protocols:
			- IP 
			- ARP 
		- PDU is called Packet 
	- Data Link - Error checking [CRC]
		- MAC Address 
		- Devices include: 
			- a Switch
			- Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) 
			- Network Interface controller (NIC)
			- Bridge
		- PDUs are called Frames 
	- Physical 
		-  Puts Signal on Wire or Channel 
		- Devices include:
			- Repeater - A Device that repeats a signal from medium to another. This device essentially increases the range a signal can travel. 
			- Hub - The same as a multi-port repeater 
		- PDUs are called Bits 

- "Look-up" Tables 
	- A "Look-up" table is part of Professor Graves' lingo that refers to the procedures that occurs during a OSI layer. 
		- For example, in a ARP "broadcast", A device with an IP address will send a request to the network to find a specific MAC address and vice versa. 
	- "Graves hiding example" 
	- 
	- "
	- ARP, Value 1: = IPv4 Address, Value 2: MAC Address
	- DNS, Value 1: Domain name (URL), Value 2:  IPv4 Address
	- CAM Table (Switch) Value 1: MAC address, Value 2: Switchport #
	- NAT, Value 1: Private IPv4 Address, Value 2: Public IPv4 Address
	- Logon Server, Value 1: Username, Value 2: Password
		- Unlike the previous procedures, the Logon server checks 

- The major Networking Identifiers:
	- Ports
	- IP Addresses (Logical)
	- MAC addresses (physical)
