- IP Addressing 
	- Minimum for connecting to the internet is the IP address and subnets 

- APIPA 
	- DHCP server could not be found 
	- Automatic Private 
	- ONLY FOR MICROSOFT PLATFORMS 

- DHCP 
	- Lease stuff
	- DHCP assigns leases 
	- Great time saver - more efficient
	- You do not use the DHCP for switches and some network devices 

- DNS (Domain Name System)
	- It's the web address for us. For example 
	- www.BC3.edu is the host address that we read
	- However, the computer reads www.BC3.edu as 123.456.789
	- DNS is the automatic conversion between the host address and IP address. 
	- One of the "Look-up tables" 
	- "Scarecrow Wizard of Oz example"
	- Forward lookup zone = host name to the IP address
	- Reverse lookup zone = IP address to the host name 

- Configuring IP addresses on a mobile device
