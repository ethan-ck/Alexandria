- Topologies
	- Bus
		- Invisible terminators on each end, straight line like a bus route (wow) 
	- Ring
		- Each node is connected to 2 other nodes on each side like a ring (wow)
	- Star
		- All nodes are connected to a switch, like a star (wow)

- Hubs send to all, inefficient and insecure
	- They're evil
- Switches send to one, switches replaced hubs
