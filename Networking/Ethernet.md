- Topologies
	- Bus
		- Invisible terminators on each end, straight line like a bus route (wow) 
		- Line must be clear in order for data to transmit 
		- If line or node goes down, it's all down (Fault tolerance)
	- Ring
		- Each node is connected to 2 other nodes on each side like a ring (wow)
		- Line or node goes down, its all down 
	- Star
		- All nodes are connected to a switch, like a star (wow)
	- Mesh
		- Every node is connected to each other, best for fault tolerance 

- Hubs send to all, inefficient and insecure
	- They're evil
- Switches send to one, switches replaced hubs 
	- No collisions

- CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection)
	- It detects collisions, not prevent them
	- Sending devices send a jam signal
	- They wait with a backoff time in ms (RNG) 
	- one retransmits first
- Process of Transmitting on a bus 
	- Device senses line (carrier) freeMessage broadcast
		- Received only by the intended destiantion 
		- Dropped by all others 

- Plexes
	- Simplex
		- Send-all
		- PA system
	- Half-Duplex
		- Send OR receive 
		- one-way
		- walkie-talkie
		- may cut speed in half
	- Full-Duplex
		- Send AND Receive
		- Cellphone
