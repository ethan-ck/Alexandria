- Subnetting "Sub-Network"
	- Ex. Dividing a network into parts for HR, Marketing....
	- Minimum to configure a network = IP address and subnet mask 

- Types of IP Addresses
	- Dotted Decimal
		- * 4 octets (8 binary digits for each octet)
		- Ex. 167.12.155.16

- Subnet Masks 
	- Determines the network (subnet) address 
	- 2 Types 
		- Classful
			- Not changing 
			- default 
			- A,B,C
			- 255.255.255.0 = C
			- 255.255.0.0 = B, and so on
		- Classless
			- AKA Variable length subnet mask (VLSM)
				- 255.255.192.0, we get a little goofy 
				- Essentially any numbers besides 255 and 0 
	- Puts up against the IP address to get the network destination 
	- In other words, Network and hosts? 
	- Local Loopback address 
		- 127.x.x.x
		- Excluded in the subnet mask octet range
			- Pings your NIC 

- Private IP Addresses
	- Not public
		- Non-routable (on Internet)
		- Hidden from Public Internet
		- NAT 
		- Secure but not really (partial security)
			- Better security would be encryption 
		- Graves hiding example
	- 3 Classes (A,B,C)
		- Class A = 10.x.x.x
		- Class B = 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x
		- Class C = 192.168.x.x
		- Holy shit these are private IP addresses! 
	- 127.0.0.1 is also a Non-Routable IP addresses (Loopback)
	-  169.254.x.x is APIPA 
		- Something is wrong 
		- It means that DHCP is down (oh god, oh fuck) 
		- Internet purgatory 

- NAT (Network Address Translation)
	- Private IP to Public IP

- ANDing 
	- This is how routers get the destination network 
	- Think like a computer
	- Needs both variables to be true
		- EX. T and T = T
		- T and F = F
		- F and T = F
		- F and F = F
