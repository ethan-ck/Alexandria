- Subnetting "Sub-Network"
	- Ex. Dividing a network into parts for HR, Marketing....
	- Minimum to configure a network = IP address and subnet mask 

- Types of IP Addresses
	- Dotted Decimal
		- * 4 octets (8 binary digits for each octet)
		- Ex. 167.12.155.16

- Subnet Masks 
	- Determines the network (subnet) address 
	- 2 Types 
		- Classful
			- Not changing 
			- default 
			- A,B,C
			- 255.255.255.0 = C
			- 255.255.0.0 = B, and so on
		- Classless
			- AKA Variable length subnet mask (VLSM)
				- 255.255.192.0, we get a little goofy 
				- Essentially any numbers besides 255 and 0 
	- Puts up against the IP address to get the network destination 
	- In other words, Network and hosts?
