- Best practice is to use both an IDS, and a firewall. IDS do not prevent intrusions, but detects them. An example of an IDS is an anti-virus. 

- IDS usually detects intrusions through two different methods:
	- SIgnatures
	- Ana

- HIDS
	- Host Intrusion Systems
		- Only one device
- NIDS 
	- Network Intrusion Systems
		- For the whole network
