- Cout is the way C++ prints data onto the console
	- It is classified as a stream object, meaning that it works with streams of data

- In order to print a message on the screen, you must send a stream of characters to cout

 cout << "Hello World!" 

	- This sends the data "Hello World!" to the cout, printing the string literal to the console

- The << operator is referred to as the stream insertion operation
