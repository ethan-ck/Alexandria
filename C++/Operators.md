- There are three types of operators: unary, binary and ternary.
- These terms reflect the number of operands an operator requires
- unary - only one operator required 
	- -5
		- When the minus sign is used this way, it is called the negation operator 
- binary - two operators required
	- 5 - 3
- ternary - three operators required 


- The modulus operator only works with integer operands and returns the REMAINDER of an integer division
	- LeftOver = 17 % 3; 
		- This is return 2, as 2 is the remainder after 17 is divided by 3.
