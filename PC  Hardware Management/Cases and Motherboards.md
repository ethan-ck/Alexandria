- Cases come in all sorts of shapes and sizes to fit the Motherboard's Form Factor
	- The Form Factor is just a fancy way to say size of the motherboard 
	- ATX Form Factor (Standard ATX)
		- Commonly used
		- 9.6x12 in.
		- has 6-7 expansion slots
	- Micro ATX Form Factor 
		- 9.6x9.6 in. 
		- only 4 expansion slots
	- Extended ATX Form Factor
		- Bigger

		- Low-power, low-temp motherboard
	- BTX Form Factor
		- Intended to replace ATX form factor, but lost
		- Roughly the same size, but different orientation
		- Rare
	- NLX
		- Unique backboard design
		- uses a riser card, allows cards to be installed parallel to the motherboard
		- rare

- Motherboard Components 
	- Allow parts to communicate with each other
	- Components of a Motherboard
		- CPU Socket 
		- Memory Slots
		- ATX Power Connector
		- CPU Power Connector
		- Case Fan Connectors
		- CPU Fan Connector
		- Expansion Slots AKA Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)
		- Front Panel Connectors
		- SATA Connectors
		- CMOS Battery
			- Supplies power to BIOS
			- Volatile, so modern motherboards don't do this 
		- Chipset
			- Manages communications between all connected components
		- I/O Connectors
		- Lines on the back of the MB are called traces 
		- 

- Installing a Motherboard 
	- I/O Shield 
	- Install Motherboard Standoffs 
		- Creates airflow behind the motherboard and prevents the traces from touching other components and shorting
	- Screw in the motherboard via standoffs
	- Attach Power supply connector (20+4 connector)
	- Connect CPU Power 
	- Connect Front Panel Connectors 

- Motherboard Troubleshooting 
	- Black Screen
		- Disconnect non-essential peripherals to the PC and try rebooting 
		- Disable all non-essential applications and put them to sleep automatically, then reboot
		- Reset to default settings using core BIOS/UEFI configurations by 
			- Ensure the boot priority is correct.
		- Launch a Windows repair and perform a system restore
		- Boot into safe mode 
	- Lack of Power
		- Check if the computer POSTs (Power-On Self Test)
			- This checks a computer's internal hardware for compatibility and connection before starting the remainder of the boot process. If it passes, it may beep once or twice depending on the hardware.
				- Ensure that the Pin 9 wire on the PSC connects to the power good wire on the MB
				- Ensure that the power supply is not failing

- BIOS password
	- Remove CMOS battery
	- Wait until 30 seconds, CMOS keeps a charge
