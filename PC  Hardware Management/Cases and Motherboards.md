- Motherboard Components 
	- Allow parts to communicate with each other
	- Components of a Motherboard
		- CPU Socket 
		- Memory Slots
		- ATX Power Connector
		- CPU Power Connector
		- Case Fan Connectors
		- CPU Fan Connector
		- Expansion Slots AKA Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)
		- Front Panel Connectors
		- SATA Connectors
		- CMOS Battery
			- Supplies power to BIOS
			- Volatile, so modern motherboards don't do this 
		- Chipset
			- Manages communications between all connected components
		- I/O Connectors
		- Lines on the back of the MB are called traces 
		- 

- Installing a Motherboard 
	- I/O Shield 
	- Install Motherboard Standoffs 
		- Creates airflow behind the motherboard and prevents the traces from touching other components and shorting
	- Screw in the motherboard via standoffs
	- Attach Power supply connector (20+4 connector)
	- Connect CPU Power 
	- Connect Front Panel Connectors
