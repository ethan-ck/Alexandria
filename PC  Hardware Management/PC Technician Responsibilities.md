Protection and Safety 
- Power Hazards 
		- Remove jewelry to prevent equipment damage
		- Make sure grounding pin is intact
		- Never work on a device until you've powered it down and unplugged it form the wall
		- For portable computers, remove the battery
		- The PSU can hold a charge for up to whole seconds after being unplugged
		- Field- Replacement unit
		- Avoid serving anything with high voltage
		- Do not wear an EST wrist strap around high voltage
		- Laser printers use laser light that can damage your eyes, and use toner which is toxic if inhaled
		- Fusers get very hot 
		- Parts could be dangerous
		- Second impact dot matrix with solenoids, the little coils in the print head can burn you
		- DvDs and CD drives can damage your eyes with a laser light 
		- Fiber optic use light that damage your eyes, never look down the end of a fiber optic 
- Thermal Hazards
		- Thermal radiation or heat, CPU , memory and heat sink generate heat, let a system cool down to prevent a severe burn 
- Physical Hazards 
		- Arrange the room that you work in to eliminate physical hazards, use proper cable management and don't leave wires on the floor 
		- Watch for places where people can trip over 
		- Lifting hazards 
			- Know your limits, lift with legs, use a cart, ask for help or wear a back brace
		- Fire Suppression
			- Every room you work in should be fire suppressed, have a Class C fire extinguishers which are made for electrical fires
		- Materials Safety Data Sheet
			- Any component that presents a potential hazards comes with its own MSDS, it explains what you should do if you come in contact with a electrical component that's potentially dangerous to you. Also details how to dispose of equipment. 
- Electrostatic Discharge
	- Static Charge - created whenever two objects come into contact with each other and then separate. 
	- Occurs when one object that has a high positve charge comes into contact with another object that has a high negative charge
	- Electrical potential jumps to the Object with the lowest potential 
	- Humans can only feel 3,000 volts, so you can damage PC parts without realizing it 
- ESD Prevention
	- Discharge yourself; use a ground to dissipate the energy, touch the case frame of the PC 
	- Use a static mat, it equalizes the electrical potential between you and the PC system
	- When handling an electrical component, never touch the gold or silver leads on the bottom, and don't touch the little tab connectors. It will short circuit 
	- Use static shielding bags, it has an additional layer under the plastic that dissipates electrical charges as they occur 
	- Remove static producing materials, materials like Plastic and Styrofoam 
	- Humidity is your friend when dealing with electrostatic discharge, the higher the humidity the lower the static. 
- Grounding 
	- Use Alligator clip to connect the ground to the case or static mat, when this is established, there is no difference in static charge that can be built up
	- Ground yourself by using a second clip and connect it to a wristband that has a little metal plate
	- Ensure that the case is unplugged before you start attaching the clips. If not, you'll be connected to 110 volts. 

Environmental Controls
- Environmental Concerns 
	- Disposal is a major concern, materials need to disposed in a specific manner
	- Most communities have laws that dictate which materials you can and can't put into the common trash, each state has its own laws. So check out
	- General rules; for batteries, you can throw Alkaline batteries in the trash, but not in California
	- Laptop and notebook batteries are Lithium ion batteries, you must contact your local environmental management office because they contain highly toxic chemicals 
	- Printer Cartridges should be recycled, also some manufacturers accept empty cartridges to refill for cheap
	- LCD, plasma, and CRT monitors could leak lead and other toxic chemicals.
	- CRT Monitors can retain a large electrical charge, up to 20,000 volts
	- For disposing of a 
	- For PSUs, discharge the PSU and recycle
	- Refer to the MSDS for preferred way to dispose of stuff 
	- Air Quality, poor environment conditions such as a hot degrades components keep temp at 68 Fahrenheit 
	- Keep humidity at an appropriate level. High humidity = condensation, and low = ESD. Recommended humidity level is 40-60% 
	- Clean your computer regularly, use compressed air or a non-static computer vacuum to remove stuff
	- Do not use strong solvent wipes for stuff
- Power Concerns 
	- Power 
		- A Power Surge Occurs when an increase in voltage lasting seconds
		- Power Spike an increase in voltage lasting milliseconds 
		- Power Sag is a decrease in voltage
		- Brownouts occur when there is too much demand on the grid
		- Blackout is a complete loss of power 
		- Surge protectors and suppressors filter out power surges before they reach the computer, they do not protect you from sags, brown-outs, or blackouts
		- Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) use a battery backup, provides power as needed, and protects from a multitude of power issues. 
		- Online UPS is where the PC doesn't draw power directly form the wall outlet, instead its fed by the battery in the UPS, but it is the best protection.
		- Offline UPS runs on 110 volts from the wall and doesn't nothing until it detects a brown-out or blackout. When it detects one, it switches off the wall outlet, and switches to the UPS battery.
		- Companies prefer an online UPS for really critical systems, such as servers. They're more expensive but the best. 
		- Time ratings may not be entirely accurate, plan for at least half of the time advertised. 
		- Configuring a UPS 
			- Plug it into the wall outlet, charge the UPS for 12 to 24 hours before you use it.
			- Once fully charged, plug a server or workstation into one of the protected outlets on the UPS
			- UPS purpose is to keep your system running long enough to shut down cleanly without losing data
			- To configure automatic shutdown, connect the management cable form the UPS to the PC system, then install the drivers required. 
			- 
		- Configure UPS Settings 
			- Charge the UPS 
			- Plug the UPS into a wall outlet
			- Plug the PC into one of the protected outlets on the UPS, be sure to plug it into ta battery backed socket, some sockets only support surge protection
			- Plug in the serial or USB cable from the UPS to the PC and download the software
			- Go to options and enable PowerChute notification sounds 
			- Go to Runtime configuration and ensure that there is plenty of time for the shutdown of the PC to occur
			- Preserve battery power is a fantastic option, it tells the computer to shut down if the power does not come back on within an allotted amount of time. Perfect during storms where the power flickers off and on.
			- Click apply
			- For notifications, the default value is perfectly fine
			- Click sensitivity, this specifies the circumstances when we want the UPS to kick in.
			- Three different sensitivity levels, Low, Medium, and High. Medium is just about right.
			- Select Voltage, this is where we define what a power event is, normal utility voltage is between 115 and 120 volts. 
			- On the bottom of the screen of voltage, you can see what the current power source is.
			- The estimated battery time assumes that there's ONE PC connected to the UPS. 
			- Also be aware of connecting other devices to the UPS, know what you want to plug in.
			- You can plug in a monitor for example, but it will bring down the estimated battery time 
			- NEVER connect a printer to your UPS, it consumes a large amount of energy.
