Capacitor - A Device that sores an electric charge

Electrostatic discharge - The flow of electricity form one electrically charged object to another

Peripheral device - A device that connects to a computer and is on the outside, like printers, mouse, keyboard, mics, monitors, speakers, etc...

Protection and Safety 
- Power Hazards 
		- Remove jewelry to prevent equipment damage
		- Make sure grounding pin is intact
		- Never work on a device until you've powered it down and unplugged it form the wall
		- For portable computers, remove the battery
		- The PSU can hold a charge for up to whole seconds after being unplugged
		- Field- Replacement unit
		- Avoid serving anything with high voltage
		- Do not wear an EST wrist strap around high voltage
		- Laser printers use laser light that can damage your eyes, and use toner which is toxic if inhaled
		- Fusers get very hot 
		- Parts could be dangerous
		- Second impact dot matrix with solenoids, the little coils in the print head can burn you
		- DvDs and CD drives can damage your eyes with a laser light 
		- Fiber optic use light that damage your eyes, never look down the end of a fiber optic 
- Thermal Hazards
		- Thermal radiation or heat, CPU , memory and heat sink generate heat, let a system cool down to prevent a severe burn 
- Physical Hazards 
		- Arrange the room that you work in to eliminate physical hazards, use proper cable management and don't leave wires on the floor 
		- Watch for places where people can trip over 
		- Lifting hazards 
			- Know your limits, lift with legs, use a cart, ask for help or wear a back brace
		- Fire Suppression
			- Every room you work in should be fire suppressed, have a Class C fire extinguishers which are made for electrical fires
		- Materials Safety Data Sheet
			- Any component that presents a potential hazards comes with its own MSDS, it explains what you should do if you come in contact with a electrical component that's potentially dangerous to you. Also details how to dispose of equipment. 
- Electrostatic Discharge
	- Static Charge - created whenever two objects come into contact with each other and then separate. 
	- Occurs when one object that has a high positve charge comes into contact with another object that has a high negative charge
	- Electrical potential jumps to the Object with the lowest potential 
	- Humans can only feel 3,000 volts, so you can damage PC parts without realizing it 
- ESD Prevention
	- Discharge yourself; use a ground to dissipate the energy, touch the case frame of the PC 
	- Use a static mat, it equalizes the electrical potential between you and the PC system
	- When handling an electrical component, never touch the gold or silver leads on the bottom, and don't touch the little tab connectors. It will short circuit 
	- Use static shielding bags, it has an additional layer under the plastic that dissipates electrical charges as they occur 
	- Remove static producing materials, materials like Plastic and Styrofoam 
	- Humidity is your friend when dealing with electrostatic discharge, the higher the humidity the lower the static. 
- Grounding 
	- Use Alligator clip to connect the ground to the case or static mat, when this is established, there is no difference in static charge that can be built up
	- Ground yourself by using a second clip and connect it to a wristband that has a little metal plate
	- Ensure that the case is unplugged before you start attaching the clips. If not, you'll be connected to 110 volts. 

Environmental Controls
- Environmental Concerns 
	- Disposal is a major concern, materials need to disposed in a specific manner
	- Most communities have laws that dictate which materials you can and can't put into the common trash, each state has its own laws. So check out
	- General rules; for batteries, you can throw AKAline batteries in the trash, but not in California
	- Laptop and notebook batteries are Lithium ion batteries, you must contact your local environmental management office because they contain highly toxic chemicals 
	- Printer Cartridges should be recycled, also some manufacturers accept empty cartridges to refill for a cheap
