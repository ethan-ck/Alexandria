- DRAM Types
	- Double Data Rate RAM (DDR)
	- DDR Ratings 
	- DRAM processes one command per clock cycle 
	- Word = 640 bits of data
	- Double pumping
	- MT/s = mega transfers/scond
	- DDR Rating = the MT/s spec
	- MHz = base speed of RAM
	- MT/s = base MHz x 2 

- PC Rating
	- Bandwidth in MB/s 
	- Data is processed in 64 bit (8-byte) words
	- to find PC rating, DDR rate x 8
	- Example DDR-266
		- 133 MHz
		- DDR2 

- DDR Ram Types
	- DDR 133-200 MHz, 266-400 MT/s, PC2100-PC3200, 2.5 Volts
	- DDR2 266 - 400 MHz, 533 - 800 MT/s, PC4200 - PC6400, 1.8 V
	- DDR3 533 - 800 MHz, 1066 - 1600 Mt/s, PC8500 - PC14900 1.5 V
	- DDR4 1066 - 1600 MHz, 2133 - 3200 MT/s PC12800 - PC25600 1.2 V, Power saving features, increased chip densities 
	- DDR5 2133 - 3200 MHz, 3200 - 6400 MT/s, PC38400 - PC51200 1.1 Volts, Power management on chip, two or four 32-bit channels for increased efficiency 

- Physical Characteristics
	- DDR has pin slightly off to the side
	- DDR2 has more pins that aren't as wide, and the notch is in the middle
	- DDR3 has more pins that aren't as wide, towards the left
	- DDr4 Notch in middle 
	- DDR5 Pin count is the same and notch to the left 

- Form Factors
	- DIMM
		- Used in desktop slots
	- So-DIMM
		- Used in laptops, half the size
	- UniDIMM
		- Upgrade to the So-DIMM, allows mobile platform users to have DDR3 or DDR4 in the same slot 

- Multi-Channel Memory
	- All data must pass through memory controllers before reaching the RAM. The multi-channel adds more memory controllers. 
	- 5% to 15% increase only
	- Also specific to motherboard and not the memory itself
	- Supported with DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5
	- Triple are supported with DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5
