- All cells have several things in common
	- Surrounded by plasma/membrane made up by phospholipids (remember that they are hydrophobic)
	- Those phospholipids have two parts, the head (hydrophobic) and the tails (fatty acids and hydrophilic). A bi-layer
	- The plasma membrane surrounds every single cell, some protein, carbs, and other organic molecules
	- DNA is found in all cells (in simple cells there is the nucleoid, which is the
