- All cells have several things in common
	- Surrounded by plasma/membrane made up by phospholipids (remember that they are hydrophobic)
	- Those phospholipids have two parts, the head (hydrophobic) and the tails (fatty acids and hydrophilic). A bi-layer
	- The plasma membrane surrounds every single cell, some protein, carbs, and other organic molecules
	- DNA is found in all cells (in simple cells there is the nucleoid, which is the region the DNA lives)
	- In the eukaryotic cells, they have a nucleus
	- All cells have ribosomes, and all contain RNA, all cells need these ribosomes to make the proteins that they are coded for in their DNA

- Modes of movement
	- Flagella, 
	- Cytoskeletons
	- Embedded proteins
	- Cytoplasm (mostly water with a ton of different stuff dissolved into them

- Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic  
	- Karyo = nut (nucleus)
	- Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus
	- Pro = before (nucleus)
	- Prokaryotic are simpler and came before, single cell organisms
	- Eu = True (nucleus)
	- Eukaryotic have nucleus, they are membrane bound, larger and more complex, some are single-celled but most are multicellular,
		- Plants 
			- Have a cell wall (like a brick wall) built around them 
			- Cells also have a plasma membrane but is molded with the cell wall, it is made up of cellulose, this allows the plant to stand up
			- More geometrically shaped like squares 
			- Chloroplasts which allow them to photosynthesize 
			- Plant also has a large central volucules (membrane bubbles) It is called a central volucule that fills with water for photosynthesis and it expands the cell to put pressure onto the cell water to help hold the plant upright. 
		- Animals
			- Rounder in shape, or vary a lot in shape
			- only surrounded by the plasma membrane (think of like a water balloon)

- Endomembrane System
	- Found in the eukaryotic cells
	- a series of these organelles that are all connected
	- Called the "Rough ER" b/c the ribosomes are connected to it to form a bumpy appearance
	- The Golgi apparatus is where all the molecules are sorted and shipped out, like a central hub for transportation. 

- The Plasma Membrane
	- A Plasma membrane marks the boundary between the outside and inside of a cell
	- It follows a fluid-mosaic model meaning that the structure of the plasma membrane is fluid-like as the molecules float around one another and mosaic-like as there are varying different types of molecule sin the membrane
	- The plasma membrane regulates passage inside and outside of a cell.
	- It is a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins 
		- Polar heads (hydrophilic) 
		- Nonpolar tails (hydrophobic)
	- Types of Membrane Proteins 
		- Channel protein 
			- Form tunnel for specific molecules
		- Transport protein 
			- Involved in passage of molecules through the membrane, sometimes requiring input of energy
		- Cell recognition protein 
			- Enables our body to distinguish between our own cells and cells or other organism 
		- Receptor Proteins
			- Allows signal molecules to bind, causing a cellular response 
		- Enzymatic protein 
			- Directly participate in metabolic reactions 
		- Junction proteins 
			- Forms the junctions between cells
			- Allows cell to cell adhesion and communication 

- Several hundred different cell types make up the human body
- Stem cells have the potential to divide almost indefinitely to produce a variety of cell types (Family Guy)
- A extracellular matrix (ECM is a meshwork of fibrous proteins and polysaccharides
- Collagen is a protein that resists stretching
- ECMs vary by the arrangement of proteins present 
- elastin gives resilience
-  Polysaccharides is to direct the migration of cells during development 
- The rough ER differs from the smooth ER b/c the RER contains ribosomes and
