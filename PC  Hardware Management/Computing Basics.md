CPU

Integrated Circuit/Die mounted on a printer circuit board

Has cores where complicated instructions are laid out

Shared L3 Cache

Ring interconnect

Memory Controller 

System Agent - Platform I/O 

Motherboard

Chipset connected directly to the System Agent in the CPU

Voltage Regulator Module VRM found near the CPU
- Drop the voltage coming from the power supply

Water-cooling
PCB - Control Chip
Stater

Power Supply - Distributes power

Main transformer
primary side high voltage
secondary side low voltage

Control PCB sends adjustment signals to the S Transitions

The connector will then send out wattage when necessary

Graphics Card - 

{CB with the GPU's integrated circuit in the center, surrounded by RAM chips 

GPU integrated circuit has more than a thousand solder pads that connects it to the PCB,  Wiith multiple cores 

On the die is a l2 memory cache, PCIe Interface for connecting to the CPU 

heat sink w/ a fan 

Ports 
Input power connector

GPUs have thousands of cores dedicated to simple arithmetic

DRAM - SSDs and Hard Drives 
CPU communicates directly with DRAm through memory channels inside the motherboard

inside DRAm Chips is a 32 memory bank 8192 columns wide by 

Stores data using capacitors and transistors 

SSDs - perm store data in arrays called 3D NAND
