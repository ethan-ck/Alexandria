- Coaxial Cables
	- Commonly used to convey data, video, and voice signals in radio, televisions, and broadband internet applications 
	- Made of 4 different components
		- Inner Conductor - made up of copper or silver
		- PVC Insulator - covers the conductor 
		- Braided Mesh Conductor - For grounding 
		- PVC Sheath - Cover the conductor 

- Coaxial Cable Standards 
	- RG-59 
		- Rarely used
		- Poor signal quality
	
	- RG-6 
		- Higher signal quality 
		- used by cable/satellite TV and internet 

- Coaxial Cable Connectors 
	- F-Type
		- Creates cable and satellite TV connections 
		- Connects a cable modem to a broadband cable connection 
		- 
	- BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) 
		- Legacy 10Base3 Ethernet networks in specialized industries


- Twisted Pair Cables
	- Reduces interference when transmitting signals. It supports a wide range of fast, modern network standards.
	- Composed of the following components 
		- PVC Sheath - Plastic insulation that surrounds each copper wire 
		- Plastic Insulator - Bundles the wires together and protects them
		- Copper Wire - 4 pairs of copper wires that carry the data signals, twisted into pairs (duh) to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk.
		- Foil Shield (Only with STP, NOT in UTP)

- Twisted Pair Standards 
	- T568A 1+2 = 3, 1+2+3 = 6(1/2 and 3/6) (GoBOBBr)
	- T568B ()

	- Cat 8.2            RJ45 (Class I)       40 Gbps          2000 MHz 
	- Each type of twisted pair is backwards-compatible, but not forwards-compatible

- Twisted Pair Rating 
	- Ratings are used for specific purposes in various construction applications
	- Direct Burial 
		- Designed to be buried directly in the ground
	- General
		- Minimum requirements in commercial installations
		- Incredibly toxic when burned, probably plays R6
	- Plenum 
		- For use in Air plenum spaces (open areas above drop ceilings or below raised floors)
		- Flame retardant (respectfully)
		- NFPA regulated (communists)
	- Riser 
		- Run between floors through open vertical shafts
		- Suited for areas not defined as plenum but may conduct fire from one floor to another
