- Twisted Pair Cables
	- Reduces interference when transmitting signals. It supports a wide range of fast, modern network standards.
	- Composed of the following components 
		- PVC Sheath - Plastic insulation that surrounds each copper wire 
		- Plastic Insulator - Bundles the wires together and protects them
		- Copper Wire - 4 pairs of copper wires that carry the data signals, twisted into pairs (duh) to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk.
		- Foil Shield (Only with STP, NOT in UTP)

- Twisted Pair Standards 
	- T568A 1+2 = 3, 1+2+3 = 6(1/2 and 3/6) (GoBOBBr)
	- T568B ()

- Twisted Pair Categories
	- Category        Connector            Speed          Frequency             Info

	- Cat 7                RJ45                  10 Gbps           600 MHz 
	- Cat 7a              RJ45                   10 Gbps          1000 MHz
	- Cat 8.1             RJ45(Class I)       25 Gbps          2000 MHz 
	- Cat 8.2            RJ45 (Class I)       40 Gbps          2000 MHz 
	- Each type of twisted pair is backwards-compatible, but not forwards-compatible

- Twisted Pair Rating 
	- Ratings are used for specific purposes in various construction applications
	- Direct Burial 
		- Designed to be buried directly in the ground
	- General
		- Minimum requirements in commercial installations
		- Incredibly toxic when burned, probably plays R6
	- Plenum 
		- For use in Air plenum spaces (open areas above drop ceilings or below raised floors)
		- Flame retardant (respectfully)
		- NFPA regulated (communists)
	- Riser 
		- Run between floors through open vertical shafts
		- Suited for areas not defined as plenum but may conduct fire from one floor to another 
		- 

- Twisted Pair Connectors 
	- RJ11 
		- 4 or 6 connectors
		- Supports up to 2 pairs (one phone and one power)
		- Telephone wiring
		- Old and outdated (Like your grandma) 
	- RJ45
		- 8 Connectors, supports up to 4 pairs
		- Using a locking tab to keep a connector secure
		- Ethernet 

- Cable Tips 
	- Use a crimping tool designed for RJ45 connectors to attach it to the UTP cable 
	- Punch-down tool
	- Use the correct connector type (duh)
	- Keep the pairs twisted as much as possible up to the connector, reduces crosstalk
	- Making Cat 6 compliant cables is incredibly difficult, (it's like my ex-wife)


- Fiber Optic Cable 
	- Delivers data, video, and voice services faster and more reliably than other cable systems (with the god-damn light, wow)
	- 4 Different components
		- Plastic Sheath
			- Encases everything and protects the cable
		- Protective Layer
			- provides a stiff structure to prevent the cladding and the central core from breaking 
		- Cladding
			- maintains the signal in the center of the core as the cable bends 
		- Central Core
			- Carries the signal, made of plastic or glass 
	- So damn fast, literally the speed of light. But is really damn expensive, like caviar 

- Fiber Optic Mode
	- These are different types of Fiber Optic Cable and are NOT interchangeable
		- Single-Mode
			- Transfers data through the core using a single light ray(also called mode)
			- Supports a large amount of data
			- extends a great distance 
		- Multi-Mode 
			- Use multiple light rays that bounce up and down
			- Limits the distances of cable lengths 

- Fiber Optic Connectors
	- ST Connector (The Rising Sun Connector)
		- Used with single mode and multi-mode cabling
		- Keyed, BAYONET-type connector
		- PUSH IN AND TWIST
		- Red and White (Kind of)
	- SC Connector (Prussian Connector)
		- used with single-mode and multi-mode cabling
		- push on, pull off connector
		- Red, white, black
	- LC Connector (Twins)
		- Used with single-mode and multi-mode cabling
		- Single connector with two ends to keep the two cables in place
		- half the size of other fiber optic connectors
	- MT-RJ Connector ()
		- used with single mode and multi-mode cabling 
		- uses metal guide pins to ensure it is properly aligned
