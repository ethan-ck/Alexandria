- Coaxial Cables
	- Commonly used to convey data, video, and voice signals in radio, televisions, and broadband internet applications 
	- Made of 4 different components
		- Inner Conductor - made up of copper or silver
		- PVC Insulator - covers the conductor 
		- Braided Mesh Conductor - For grounding 
		- PVC Sheath - Cover the conductor 

- Coaxial Cable Standards 
	- RG-59 
		- Rarely used
		- Poor signal quality
	
	- RG-6 
		- Higher signal quality 
		- used by cable/satellite TV and internet 

- Coaxial Cable Connectors 
	- F-Type
		- Creates cable and satellite TV connections 
		- Connects a cable modem to a broadband cable connection 
		- 
	- BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) 
		- Legacy 10Base3 Ethernet networks in specialized industries


- Twisted Pair Cables
	- Reduces interference when transmitting signals. It supports a wide range of fast, modern network standards.
	- Composed of the following components 
		- PVC Sheath - Plastic insulation that surrounds each copper wire 
		- Plastic Insulator - Bundles the wires together and protects them
		- Copper Wire - 4 pairs of copper wires that carry the data signals, twisted into pairs (duh) to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk.
		- Foil Shield (Only with STP, NOT in UTP)
