- Storage Devices
	- Long term storage devices
		- Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
			- Composed of many platters that are magnetized and demagnetized to read and write data with heads (like a record player)
			- Armature is the hand with a read/write head on the end of it
			- the Bernoulli Effects the small cushion of air between the disk and read/write heads 
			- For Rotation Speeds, cheap hard drives spin at around 5400 Rotations per minute (RPM), 7200 RPM, 10,000 RPM, and 15,000 RPM. 
			- Disadvantages include the fact that they are not portable and the USB interface is too large
		- Solid State Drives (SSDs)
			- Uses flash memory instead of platters 
			- Found in smartphones, camera, laptops, and fitness trackers
			- No mechanical parts so they don't consume much heat or energy, so they are more reliable
			- M.2 is usually found in laptops
			- NVMe (Non volatile memory express) is made for accessing non-votatile storage through a PCI slot. 
		- Flash Drives
			- Flash memory 
			- uses rows of memory chips, they are programmable and differ from other storage devies
			- USB interface 
		- Flash devices
			- Card reader (think of a trailcam)
			- Portable 
			- as fast as a standard hard drive
			- small physical device and large storage
		- Optical Disk Drive
			- CDs, DVDs, and Blue-ray 
			- They use LIGHT, 
			- Rainbow effect is caused by the light hitting the encoded binary stuff
			- Portable
			- Good storage capacity
			- prone to scratches (This disk is either dirty or damaged)
			- 

- SATA Serial advanced technology attachment
	- Uses a single cable to create a point to point connection between devices
	- Serial bus architecture 
	- Inside the cable, there are two pairs of wires(?) that are used for Data and ACK. The data and ACK both have two lines, one for TX and one for RX.
