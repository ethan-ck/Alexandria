- Hub is a dumb device (Physical Layer 1), it basically just puts the signal out there.
	- They're evil because they have no identifier, they just send it to everybody and anybody
		- poor performance (splits bandwidth) and security issue
		- "Kid with no filter example"
	- lives in layer 1 
	- repeater 
- Routers connect different Networks
	- Router outside of the LAN is known as the default gateway 
- Managed vs Unmanaged Switch
	- Managed Switches allow you to tweak the settings
	- Unmanaged is plug and play 
- ISDN is a WLAN technology 
	- Don't worry about it rn (telephone type technology)
- Uplink Port/WAN Port 

- Network Adapters (NIC Cards)
	- In addition to Ethernet, you can have a WiFi connection (WAP)
	- Modem converts analog to digital 
	- Modulation/Demodulation
		- Analog is a wave (Phone or voice)
		- Digital is also a wave(but digital wow square wave 1,0,1,0,1,0)
- Transceivers
	- Translates 1 and 0's into + and - charges
	- Layer 1 only
	- it's inside the NIC card
	- SFP
		- Small Form Factor
	- GBIC 
		- Giga Bit Interface Converter
	- QSFP
		- Quad SFP
		- compact, "hot-pluggable"
	- Bi Di (Bidirectional) transceiver
- MAC Address on the NIC card
	- 48-Bit Address = 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits
	- 1st half is the manufacturer (first 3 pairs)
	- 2nd half is the device (last 3 pairs)
- Address Resolution Protocol
	- Have IP address, need MAC address
	-  Lives on Layer 3 
	- 1. Broadcasts address (all F's) as Destination MAC
		- Forces NIC to process
	- 2. Devices with MAC matching IP respond
	- 3. Device stores MAC in ARP table
		- Sends packet with correct destination AMC 
	- RARP is the Reverse ARP, it is used for MAC to IP 
- Hubs
	- Essential just repeaters
	- Lives in layer 1
	- See above for more information 
- Bridge 
	- Layer 2 
	- It's an in-between a Hub and switch
	- It splits the LAN into 2 halves, creating 2 separate broadcast domains 
	- Reduces issue in half 
	- A gatekeeper 
- Switch
	- Layer 2
	- Each switch port is it's own segment 
	- As MACs are learned, it sends the message to the correct note 
		- More SECURE and EFFICIENT 
	- (A layer 3 switch routes over the IP address)
	- Starts with an Empty Forward Table 
		- As devices send and receive data, the switch learns which ports and mac addresses match (it's alive)
	- A better bridge 
- Wireless Access Point (WAP)
	- Layer 2 
	- Like a HUB but data is only received by the intended device
		- Better for security
	- Functions as a bridge between wired LAN and Wireless LANs 
- Internetwork Devices
	- Layer 3 devices that connect 2 or more subnets (networks)
	- Routers, Firewalls (normally router), Layer 3 Switch 
- Router
	- Multiple network interfaces 
		- Interface is a fancy way to say a way IN or OUT of a network 
	- Builds a table of each connectors network (Multi-layered web)
	- Shares the routing table with nearby routers (it's alive too)
- Firewall
	- Secures Local area networks from outside intruders and hackerman 
	- Determines what traffic enters/leave network
	- Packet-Filtering Firewall
		- Decides based on source/destination IP address)
- Layer 3 Switches
	- uses IP address for forwarding
	- IP address between networks/LANs
	- MAC address within Networks/LAN
